# Covid-Data-Analysis-project-
This is a small data analysis project on Covid-19 dataset taken from genuine Indian website www.covid19india.org/ and downloaded the data as CSV file. 

I worked on this project so as to better my pandas and matplotlib skills in Data Analytics by using skills in a real world project. 
This is a Covid Data Analysis project, I have made this with sincere effort and gained knowledge into Data Analysis.In this project I have used Jupyter
notebook to run my code and analysis. 
First, I cleaned the data, merged all the data frames and saved it into csv file.
Then, I imported that csv file and did the analysis using pandas on various factors and tried to present it into a plots and charts and created a sample report.
